[00:05.53] And disciplinary remains mercifully

[00:08.19] Yes and um, I'm with you Derek, this star nonsense
[00:11.98] Yes, yes
[00:12.57] Now which is it?
[00:13.65] I am sure of it
[00:16.13] ♪
[01:34.40] So, so you think you can tell
[01:41.43] Heaven from hell?
[01:45.14] Blue skies from pain?
[01:49.36] Can you tell a green field
[01:53.49] From a cold steel rail?
[01:57.88] A smile from a veil?
[02:01.90] Do you think you can tell?

[03:37.99] The same old fears
[03:41.71] Wish you were here
